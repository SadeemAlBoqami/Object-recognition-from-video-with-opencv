# Object-recognition-from-video-with-opencv
Running a YOLOv8-ready model to detect multiple objects within a video using OpenCV.
## Overview:
This project uses the YOLOv8 Nano model integrated with OpenCV to detect multiple objects in real-time from video files. It's lightweight, fast, and easy to run.

## Requirements
1. from anaconda>>base>>open terminal install these packages:
pip install opencv-python
pip install ultralytics opencv-python

2. after that open vs code from terminal by typing: code .
3. open your project folder which contains the model code and video that will be tested.
4. in same folder, create python file or ![download it from here.] (yolo_detect.py)
